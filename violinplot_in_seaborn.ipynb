    "# 1. What is Violinplot?\n",
    "\n",
    "A Violin Plot is a chart that shows the distribution of a numeric variable â€” similar to a box plot, but more detailed.\n",
    "\n",
    "It combines:\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot (showing median, quartiles, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A density plot (showing how values are spread out)\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸŸ£ In Seaborn, it's created using sns.violinplot().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. âœ… What It Looks Like\n",
    "\n",
    "A violin plot looks like a symmetrical shape (like a violin ðŸŽ»), which shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the data is concentrated (fatter areas)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where the data is sparse (thinner areas)\n",
    "\n",
    "Median and quartile lines inside (just like a boxplot)\n",
    "\n",
