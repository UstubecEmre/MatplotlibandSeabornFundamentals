    "# 1.What is a Heatmap in Seaborn?\n",
    "A heatmap is a graphical representation of data where values are represented using color intensity. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Seaborn, itâ€™s typically used to visualize 2D data like matrices or correlation tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Why Do We Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Visualizing Correlations\n",
    "One of the most common uses is for displaying the correlation matrix of a DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Code Example\n",
    "\n",
    "corr = df.corr()\n",
    "\n",
    "sns.heatmap(corr, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')\n",
    "\n",
    "This quickly shows how strongly variables relate to each other (from -1 to +1), which is essential in:\n",
    "\n",
    "o Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "o Multicollinearity detection\n",
    "\n",
    "o Model interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Spotting Patterns in Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Heatmaps are also used to visualize:\n",
    "\n",
    "o Confusion matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "o Pivot tables (e.g. sales by region and month)\n",
    "\n",
    "o Missing data \n",
    "\n",
    "> Code Example\n",
    "sns.heatmap(df.isnull())\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Enhancing Insight with Colors\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of color intensifies perception.\n",
    " \n",
    "Darker or brighter colors naturally draw attention, so patterns, outliers, or trends become more obvious compared to a numerical table."
