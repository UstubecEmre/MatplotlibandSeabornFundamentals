# üìä Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

Welcome to the **Data Visualization Training Repository**, created to help learners understand the core concepts and practical applications of **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** ‚Äî the most popular Python libraries for data visualization.

---

## üìö About This Repository

This repository covers the **foundations of data visualization** in Python.

- Each concept is first explained **theoretically**.
- Then reinforced with **hands-on examples** in separate `.ipynb` notebooks.
- The goal is to make learners comfortable with both the syntax and the **"why"** behind different chart types.
